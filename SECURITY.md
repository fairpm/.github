## Responding to Vulnerability Reports

The FAIR team takes security bugs very seriously.  We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. We will work with you  to deal with the security issue as best as possible.

## Disclosing a Vulnerability

Once an issue is reported, FAIR uses the following disclosure process:

- When a report is received, we confirm the issue and determine its severity together with the FAIR security team.
- If we know of specific third-party services or software that require mitigation before publication, those projects will be notified.
- An advisory is prepared (but not published) which details the problem and steps for mitigation.
- Patch releases are published and the advisory is published.
- Release notes and our CHANGELOG.md will include a `Security` section with a link to the advisory.

We credit reporters for identifying vulnerabilities, although we will keep your name confidential if you request it.
