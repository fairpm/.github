# Welcome to the FAIR Package Manager Project

The FAIR Package Manager is an open-source initiative backed by the Linux Foundation. Our goal is to rethink how software is distributed and managed in the world of open web publishing. We focus on decentralization, transparency, and giving users more control. Our community brings together developers, infrastructure providers, and open web contributors and advocates who all share the same mission: to move away from centralized systems and empower site owners and hosting providers with greater independence.

FAIR is governed through open working groups and consensus-driven processes, ensuring that its development reflects the needs of the broader community. Whether you're a contributor, a host, or an end user, FAIR invites participation at every level, from writing code and documentation, to community organisation and governance. As a community-led project, we aim to build public digital infrastructure that is both resilient and fair.

### üöÄ Technology

The FAIR Package Manager is a decentralized alternative to the central WordPress.org plugin and theme ecosystem, designed to return control to WordPress hosts and developers. It operates as a drop-in WordPress plugin, seamlessly replacing existing centralized services with a federated, open-source infrastructure.

There are two core pillars of the FAIR system:

* **API Replacement:** It replaces communication with WordPress.org APIs (such as update checks and event feeds) using local or FAIR-governed alternatives. Some features‚Äîlike browser version checks‚Äîare handled entirely within the plugin using embedded logic (e.g., browserslist).

* **Decentralized Package Management:** FAIR introduces a new package distribution model for themes and plugins. It supports opt-in packages that use the FAIR protocol and enables hosts to configure their own mirrors for plugin/theme data using AspirePress or their own domains. While stable plugins currently use mirrors of WordPress.org, future versions will fully support FAIR-native packages.

Hosts can distribute FAIR to their customers via:

* **Standalone Plugin:** Easily installed on existing WordPress sites.
* **FAIR Distro:** A full WordPress distribution with FAIR preinstalled‚Äîideal for provisioning workflows.

Hosts may also configure their own repository mirrors and toggle settings like Gravatar use. With minimal setup and modular architecture, the FAIR system ensures technical independence, resilience, and long-term sustainability for WordPress deployments.
