# FAIR package manager for WordPress

We’ve created and released the FAIR package manager to provide a sustainable, transparent path forward for WordPress and intend to also ensure its governance.

## Features

* *Eliminates reliance on any single source* for core updates, plugins, themes, and translations, enabling federation across the ecosystem from trusted sources.
* *Advances WordPress’s alignment towards security regulations* to improve privacy and security by dramatically reducing automatic browser data transmission and telemetry sent to commercial entities.
* *Brings together a fragmented ecosystem* by bringing together plugins from any source, not just a central source, while creating a foundation for modern security practices.
* *Builds security into the supply chain*, including improved cryptographic security measures, enhanced browser compatibility checking, and enabling reliance on trusted source security salts.

## Who built this?

FAIR was built by a group of concerned people in the ecosystem, who banded together to create a path forward.
